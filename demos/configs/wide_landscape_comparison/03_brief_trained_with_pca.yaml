# Configuration 3: Brief Training Landscape with PCA Directions
#
# Goal: See the landscape after brief training (same epochs as pca_brief_epochs)
# Method: Train same epochs as config 1's pca_brief_epochs, then sample
#
# This shows the landscape at the position after brief training,
# using PCA directions. Useful for comparison with config 1.

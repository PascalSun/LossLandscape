# Configuration 2: Trained Landscape with PCA Directions
#
# Goal: See the landscape at trained position using PCA directions
# Method: Full training, compute PCA directions, save them, then sample
#
# IMPORTANT: Run this FIRST to generate PCA directions file
# Then config 1 will load these directions for consistent comparison
